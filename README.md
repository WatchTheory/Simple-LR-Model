# Simple Linear Regression Model
** Brief Description:** <p>
Building a simple Linear Regression is not very difficult at all. The project was manily to learn the process of machine learning, the different steps it takes to get to the results and to understand each step and why its important to get the result we are looking for. 

We walk throguht a iris dataset first, to get comfortable with the steps then I use a real-world dataset from kaggle.

## Usage 
I used google colab to run everything 
For use download the ipynb file and run in your favoriate IDE.

## Algorithm
For this simple project I picked Linear Regression model it's easy to understand for beginners, easy to get up and go. 

## Dataset 
For the dataset I used :  [Kaggle - Rain In Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

I used this dataset because it had a good for learning, it was well documented, well maintained and clean data. When your start out it best start at level 0 and work your way up from there.
